# ZDE---Tower-Defense-Wars-Prototype
Scripts, Assets and files involved in the creation of this title. To show the efforts of learning game design, starting with little experience.

The project was started in January 2015, by a team of individuals with little game development experience and the intent of learning the design and production process of game production. Working within a self-learning environment and guided by peers to ensure common mistakes and performance issues are avoided.

NOTE: This project is both a rough draft and experimentation in learning the common tools and skills for game programming and production to market. The project itself would require re-design and optimization before a true prototype could be derived from this program. The reason being that the bulk of the scripts are more representative of the programmers playing with the different functions and concepts commonly used in game programming, along with understanding the fundamental concepts of game terminology and methodology.
